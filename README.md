# BuildMate – AI Powered PC Builder

## BuildMate is a modern AI-driven web application that helps users generate the perfect PC build based on their budget and performance needs.
This project started as a fun idea I wanted to try out, and I decided to push it further by collaborating with AI to turn the concept into a real, working website.

The result is a small, experimental project that mixes PC-building knowledge with AI-powered recommendations.

Hosted on Vercel for fast performance and smooth user experience:
